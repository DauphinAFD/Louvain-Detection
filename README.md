# Louvain-Detection

Here I have Implemented Louvain Community Detection using a Doctor Thesis [Community Detection on the GPU](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/handle/1956/16753/PaperIII.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#:~:text=This%20is%20done%20by%20first,compute%20resources%20on%20the%20GPU.) in CUDA C/C++. The Results show that the Computational speed is much faster than the respective sequential Implementation.
